        "This example shows how LlamaParse and LlamaIndex can be used to parse various types of legal documents, which may contain complex tabular data. The advantage of this is being able to quickly retrieve a specific answer to a legal question with comprehensive context — knowledge of precedents, statutes, and cases presented in the given documents. A user can quickly find the answer to or find out more details about a specific legal question without having to read through the often long documents by using LLMs.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we will be using legal documents from the archive of the Library of Congress ([link to dataset](https://www.loc.gov/item/2020445568/)). These documents vary by format, with some containing pure text and others containing headings, sections, and large tables. This shows how LlamaParse can parse a wide variety of documents and still retrieve accurate results.\n",
