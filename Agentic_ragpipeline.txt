Agentic RAG enhances traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation by decomposing the process into specialized, autonomous AI agents. This pipeline ensures precision, reduces hallucinations, and optimizes context-aware responses. Below is a breakdown of the components and workflow:


Input Query: The userâ€™s question or request initiates the pipeline.

1.. Router Agent:

Role: Determines the query's intent, domain, and optimal retrieval strategy.

Function: Routes requests to domain-specific databases or external tools (e.g., APIs, vector stores).

Example: A medical query might trigger access to PubMed datasets, while a coding question routes to GitHub repositories.

2.. Retrieval Agent:

Role: Fetches contextually relevant documents or data chunks from the routed source.

Function: Employs embedding models and similarity search algorithms (e.g., cosine similarity) to retrieve top-k candidates.

3. Grader Agent:

Role: Evaluate the quality and relevance of retrieved content.

Function: Uses a scoring model to rank snippets by confidence, eliminating low-quality or irrelevant results.

4. Hallucination Grader:

Role: Flags inaccuracies or unsupported claims in generated drafts.

Function: Cross-checks outputs against retrieved evidence using rule-based checks or a secondary LLM validator.

5. Answer Generator Agent:

Role: Synthesizes the final response.

Function: Combines graded evidence and query intent to generate a coherent, citation-backed answer
