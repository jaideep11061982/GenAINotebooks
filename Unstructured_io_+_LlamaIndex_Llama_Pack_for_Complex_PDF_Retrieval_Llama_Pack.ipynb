Our  position  in  markets  relating  to  AI  has  led  to  increased  interest  in  our  business  from  regulatorsworldwide, including  the European  Union, the United  States, and China.  For example,  the French Competition Authority  collected informationfrom  us  regarding  our  business  and  competition  in  the  graphics  card  and  cloud  service  provider  market  as  part  of  an  ongoing  inquiry  intocompetition in those markets. We have also received requests for information from regulators in the European Union and China regarding oursales of GPUs and our efforts to allocate supply, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Revisions to laws orregulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to importduties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our businessplans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate orplan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import orexport  regulations,  including  deemed  export  restrictions  and  restrictions  on  the  activities  of  U.S.  persons,  trade  and  economic  sanctions,decrees,  quotas  or  other  trade  barriers  and  restrictions  could  affect  our  ability  to  ship  products,  provide  services  to  our  customers  andemployees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. governmentrestricted  parties  lists  (which  is  expected  to  change  from  time  to  time),  and  generally  fulfill  our  contractual  obligations  and  have  a  materialadverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S.laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which couldhave a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.For  example,  in  response  to  the  war  in  Ukraine,  the  United  States  and  other  jurisdictions  imposed  economic  sanctions  and  export  controlmeasures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year2023,  we  stopped  direct  sales  to  Russia  and  closed  business  operations  in  Russia.  Concurrently,  the  war  in  Ukraine  has  impacted  EndCustomer sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.The  increasing  focus  on  the  risks  and strategic  importance of AI  technologies  has  resulted  in regulatory  restrictions that target  products  andservices capable of enabling or  facilitating AI,  and  may  in  the  future  result  in  additional  restrictions  impacting  some  or  all  of  our  product  andservice offerings.Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AIapplications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can beused  for  training,  refining,  and  deploying  large  language  models.\n",

If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S.laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which couldhave a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.For  example,  in  response  to  the  war  in  Ukraine,  the  United  States  and  other  jurisdictions  imposed  economic  sanctions  and  export  controlmeasures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year2023,  we  stopped  direct  sales  to  Russia  and  closed  business  operations  in  Russia.  Concurrently,  the  war  in  Ukraine  has  impacted  EndCustomer sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.The  increasing  focus  on  the  risks  and strategic  importance of AI  technologies  has  resulted  in regulatory  restrictions that target  products  andservices capable of enabling or  facilitating AI,  and  may  in  the  future  result  in  additional  restrictions  impacting  some  or  all  of  our  product  andservice offerings.Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AIapplications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can beused  for  training,  refining,  and  deploying  large  language  models.\n",

These changes include increased antitrust legislation, regulation, and a greater focus on cybersecurity. Additionally, there have been revisions to laws and regulations that have led to increased taxation, trade sanctions, and import/export restrictions. Trade protection and national security policies have also been enacted, affecting the ability to ship products and provide services. Moreover, in response to the war in Ukraine, economic sanctions and export control measures have been implemented, which have halted the passage of products, services, and support into certain regions and resulted in the cessation of direct sales and business operations in Russia. There is also an increasing regulatory focus on AI technologies, leading to restrictions on products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI. Concerns about the misuse of AI have led to potential restrictions on products used for AI applications.'"
